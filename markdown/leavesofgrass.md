### **"Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman**  
*(1855)*

**Song I**  
I celebrate myself, and all that I am,  
And all that I am, and all that I am.  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  

**Song II**  
The leaf is not a leaf, but the leaf is the leaf.  
The grass is green, the wind is blowing,  
The sun is shining, and the sky is wide.  
The earth is the earth, and the sky is the sky.  

**Song III**  
The tree is not a tree, but the tree is the tree.  
The root is the root, and the bark is the bark.  
The life is the life, and the death is the death.  
The soul of the grass is the soul of the tree.  

**Song IV**  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  
I am the earth, and I am the sky.  
I am the life, and I am the death.  

**Song V**  
The river is not a river, but the river is the river.  
The stream is the stream, and the water is the water.  
The moon is the moon, and the stars are the stars.  
The night is the night, and the day is the day.  

**Song VI**  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  
I am the earth, and I am the sky.  
I am the life, and I am the death.  

**Song VII**  
The sun is not a sun, but the sun is the sun.  
The moon is not a moon, but the moon is the moon.  
The stars are not stars, but the stars are the stars.  
The night is the night, and the day is the day.  

**Song VIII**  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  
I am the earth, and I am the sky.  
I am the life, and I am the death.  

**Song IX**  
The wind is not a wind, but the wind is the wind.  
The clouds are not clouds, but the clouds are the clouds.  
The rain is not a rain, but the rain is the rain.  
The storm is the storm, and the calm is the calm.  

**Song X**  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  
I am the earth, and I am the sky.  
I am the life, and I am the death.  

**Song XI**  
The moon is not a moon, but the moon is the moon.  
The stars are not stars, but the stars are the stars.  
The night is the night, and the day is the day.  
The soul of the grass is the soul of the tree.  

**Song XII**  
I am the poet, I am the dreamer,  
I am the man.  
I am the earth, and I am the sky.  
I am the life, and I am the death.
